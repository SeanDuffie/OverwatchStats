# TODO: Track leaderboard statistics when pressing tab
# NOTE: Eliminations / Damage dealt show how often someone you shoot dies.
#   The better this ratio is, the more effective the damage that you deal is, as you are actually getting elims and not feeding tanks/support
# NOTE: Eliminations are given when you contribute *UNHEALED* damage to a kill
# NOTE: Assists are given when you apply a buff/healing to an ally who gets a kill, or a debuff to an enemy who is killed.
